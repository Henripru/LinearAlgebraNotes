# This is the repository for CS390: Computer Vision Mathematics

I have compiled the materials that I produced during our spring sessions. This includes homework, lecture notes, and a collection of PYHON NOTEBOOKS which demonstrates the use of computer vision mathematics in the form of a computer science project.
